INSTALLING THIS RELEASE OF SERVAL BATPHONE
------------------------------------------

This version of the BatPhone application contains the IJetty webserver integrated into it. Installation is done as usual, via the ant build.xml script. However, the -lib deps/ijetty.jar will need to be passed to ant:

   $ ant debug -lib deps/ijetty.jar

This is because IJetty relies on pre-compiled classes from the original Jetty project.
